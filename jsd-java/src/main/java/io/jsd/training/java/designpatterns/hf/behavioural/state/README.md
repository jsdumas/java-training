# STATE PATTERN

## Encapsulates state-based behaviors and uses delegation to switch between behaviours.

In State pattern a class behavior changes based on its state. 
This type of design pattern comes under behavior pattern.

In State pattern, we create objects which represent various states and a context object whose behavior varies as its state object changes.
