# Hi, Welcome to my training work space

The goal of this project is twofold.

Firstly, it allows me to improve my programming skills.

In a second time, technical recruiters can see and evaluate these skills.

So, let's consider it like a portfolio.

Expertise in development industry  is exciting but terribly wide.

Full stack developer is a myth. Otherwise he is not an expert.

Of course I want to improve my knowledge and mastering diferrent technologies about continuous delivery, cloud computing, microservices and big data.

But I stay focused on my main job : designing and writing code with a particular attention according to quality, clean code and test.

TDD is my credeau.

Regards

Jean-SÃ©bastien
